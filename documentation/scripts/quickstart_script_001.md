## Production notes

- **Screen-rec capture:** 1920×1080, 60fps, hide personal paths. Use a clean demo project named `demo/`.
- **Gen-AI shots:** Shot 1 only. Generate with the app itself (eat the dogfood) — Nano Banana Pro, prompt: `falPipe logo glitching onto a moody cinematographer's desk, neon rim light, 35mm`.
- **VO:** single take, conversational, ~155 wpm. Leave 0.2s headroom at cuts.
- **Music:** low-bpm synth bed, duck under VO. Drop out on shot 9 for the reveal.
- **Captions:** burn-in lowercase, bottom-third, mono font to match the README ascii vibe.
- **End card:** 1s freeze on final frame + URL `falpipe.ai` / repo link. (Counts toward the 30s budget if added — trim shot 9 to 2s.)
